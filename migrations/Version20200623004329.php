Nonetheless, Milan for once showed their ruthless edge scoring twice in three minutes before the hour mark, first through Giacomo Bonaventura’s instinctive finish and then when Ante Rebic finished a 1-on-1 perfectly.

Prati is mostly remembered for his highly successful and prolific stint under Rossoneri boss Nereo Rocco in the 60s and 70s, a spell in which he won a Serie A title, a European Cup, two Cup Winners’ Cups, an Intercontinental Cup, and two Coppa Italia titles, forming an excellent partnership with Gianni Rivera.

You were a shining light for us all and shall be dearly missed: rest in peace Piero.” Filippo Galli expressed his condolences on Instagram, stating: “You were a champion, on and off the pitch. Your sensitivity and humility have been an example for everyone.
